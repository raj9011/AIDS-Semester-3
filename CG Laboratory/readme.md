# Computer Graphics Laboratory 

## I have implemented 7 Assignments by using following concepts while implementation

### Assignment 1 : C++ program to draw a concave polygon and fill it with desired color using scan fill Algorithm

### Assignment 2 : C++ program to implement Cohen Southerland line clipping algorithm.
### Assignment 3 : C++ program to draw the following pattern. Use DDA line and Bresenhamâ€˜s circledrawing algorithm. Apply the concept of encapsulation

### Assignment 4 : C++ program to draw 2-D object and perform following basic transformations: Scaling , Traslation , Rotation

### Assignment 5 : C++ program to generate snowflake using concept of fractals.

### Assignment 6 : C++ program to draw 3-D cube transformations on it usingOpenGL : Scaling , Translation , Rotation about an axis (X/Y/Z)

### Assignment 7 : C++ program to implement bouncing ball using sine wave form. Apply the concept of polymorphism

### Assignment 8 : Implemented one mini project
